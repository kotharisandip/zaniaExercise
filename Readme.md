# Part 4: Document App
This project is a simple document management application composed of a frontend (React) and backend (Flask) service. The application is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose.

This is for part 4 of the exercise. The document for this code is PersonalLearningV3.docx. Although this is developed from Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3, but truly it is not verified for them again. So it may not work for part 1, Part 2 and part 3 of the exercise.
